# Cricket-with-Python3
Hi! I have created a game of cricket using python. Hope you enjoy!

I have used basic Python3 if/else statements, for loops, functions, etc. to make a really interesting game of cricket.
You will be competing against the compter and at the end you will get to know who's the winner. 
For more info and details open the project and play the game.
You will enjoy it for sure!
